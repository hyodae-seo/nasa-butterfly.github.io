## Role in Investigation:
Co-Investigator: SO1A Deputy Lead. Responsible for the observational analysis of small-scale Butterfly fluxes and flux gradients, including their relationship with storm variability. Comparison of Butterfly flux variability with WRF model fluxes to determine sources of model bias. Development of relevant atmospheric (to isolate storm-region) and oceanic (to isolate modes of sea-surface temperature) diagnostic masks for application in both observational and modelling analyses. Serving as advisor to graduate students and early career scientists, to provide both scientific and career mentorship. Promoting accessibility in STEM through dissemination of Butterfly results at outreach events. 

## Experience Related to the Investigation:
Dr. Parfitt is currently an assistant professor of meteorology and oceanography at FSU, whose research lab focuses on marine meteorology and mid-latitude climate variability. He has published at length, with both domestic and international collaborators, on the interaction between the mid-latitude ocean and the atmosphere on all timescales. His primary focus has been on the role of small-scale turbulent heat fluxes in the development of extreme weather, providing extensive experience with the simulation and analysis of turbulent heat fluxes and their gradients in both high-resolution models and observational datasets. For the past five years, he has also led and contributed to the development of multiple diagnostic techniques now commonly used in the objective analysis of: storm variability (e.g. cold sector, atmospheric frontal masks), ocean variability (e.g. Gulf Stream SST gradient index), as well as their air-sea interaction (e.g. “thermal damping and strengthening” through frontal-scale turbulent heat flux gradients). Dr. Parfitt currently sits on the editorial board of Atmospheric Science Letters and is a member of the CLIVAR Climate Dynamics Panel.
