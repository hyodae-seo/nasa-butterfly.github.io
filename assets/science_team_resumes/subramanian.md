## Role in Investigation:
Co-Investigator:  Dr. Subramanian is the co-lead on modeling and prediction experiments for this proposal. Will design the data assimilation and initialized prediction experiments for the project. He will also serve as the deputy lead to engage with operational forecasting centers. Work with Dr. Lee and operational partners for forecast verification and ingestion of the data in operational systems. Will serve as lead for the model/assimilation application of the project. He will also mentor graduate students and post-doctoral scientists from diverse background in his research group to become next-generation leaders in satellite data assimilation. 

## Experience Related to the Investigation:
Dr. Subramanian is currently an Assistant Professor at the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Department in the University of Colorado Boulder leading a research group on climate process understanding, high resolution air-sea coupled modeling and predictability. He is working on improving subseasonal prediction of extreme weather using global weather and climate models (such as the Community Earth System Model (CESM) and ECMWF IFS). He has previously worked on NASA Rapidscat mission funded projects as a co-I to investigate air-sea coupling on diurnal timescales using scatterometer winds. Another focus of his work is on data assimilation in coupled ocean-atmosphere models. He has worked on assimilating ship cruise and satellite observed data into a regional eddy-permitting ocean model of the South East Pacific to better understand mesoscale ocean processes. He has extensive experience on subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) prediction research and has recently lead a community whitepaper on the need for more observations at the air-sea interface to improve S2S predictions.
