Butterfly is a mission that focused on accelerating science for big societal impact. The fastest way to do that is by designing a project to be organized around open science.

- Open data
Butterfly data will be completely public and open.
- Open access
All our published reserach will be open access.
- Open source software
All our software will have an open source license and be public on github. We believe this approach will advance algorithm development and science faster.
